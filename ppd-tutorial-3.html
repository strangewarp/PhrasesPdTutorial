					<b>3. Advanced Commands</b><br/>

					Now, having saved a file, you might be looking at the loadfile box warily, dreading the fact that you would have to type in filenames during a performance. But there is a feature to alleviate this! In the Editor Window, if you look at the rightmost column, you will see a numbered list from 1 to 20. These are the loadfile hotseats.<br/>
					<br/>
					You can change your hotseats list by editing the contents of <b>phrases-hotseats.lua</b>. Hit <b>Shift-Number</b> or <b>Shift-Backspace-Number</b> to toggle between loadfile hotseats, and then hit <b>Shift-Tab-Enter</b> to load the corresponding songfile.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>NOTE:</b> Loading any songfile will erase any unsaved songdata you might have been editing in the Editor Window.<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to entering MIDI notes with the computer keyboard, PhrasesPd also allows the user to enter MIDI data with an external MIDI device. If you didn't set one previously, go to Puredata's "Media" menu, select "MIDI Settings", and then set the "Input Device" to whatever MIDI device you want to use.<br/>
					<br/>
					Hit <b>Shift-O</b> and <b>Shift-P</b> to select the MIDI-Catch type, which changes PhrasesPd's behavior when it receives notes from the MIDI input device.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now, make sure you are in REC mode, and try entering commands with your MIDI input device. PhrasesPd ought to be catching them now!<br/>
					<br/>
					Undo and Redo are <b>Shift-Tab-Z</b> and <b>Shift-Tab-Y</b>, respectively. Undo history is 50 states deep.<br/>
