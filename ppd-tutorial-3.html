					<br/>
					<b>3. Advanced Commands</b><br/>
					<br/>
					Now, having saved a file, you might be looking at the loadfile box warily, dreading the fact that you would have to type in filenames during a performance. But there is a feature to alleviate this! In the Editor Window, if you look at the rightmost column, you will see a numbered list from 1 to 20. These are the loadfile hotseats.<br/>
					<br/>
					You can change your hotseats list by editing the contents of <b>phrases-hotseats.lua</b>. Hit <b>Shift-Number</b> or <b>Shift-Backspace-Number</b> to toggle between loadfile hotseats, and then hit <b>Shift-Tab-Enter</b> to load the corresponding songfile.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>NOTE:</b> Loading any songfile will erase any unsaved songdata you might have been editing in the Editor Window.<br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to entering MIDI notes with the computer keyboard, PhrasesPd also allows the user to enter MIDI data with an external MIDI device. If you didn't set one previously, go to Puredata's "Media" menu, select "MIDI Settings", and then set the "Input Device" to whatever MIDI device you want to use.<br/>
					<br/>
					Hit <b>Shift-O</b> and <b>Shift-P</b> to select the MIDI-Catch type, which changes PhrasesPd's behavior when it receives notes from the MIDI input device.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now, make sure you are in REC mode, and try entering commands with your MIDI input device. PhrasesPd ought to be catching them now!<br/>
					<br/>
					Undo and Redo are <b>Shift-Tab-Z</b> and <b>Shift-Tab-Y</b>, respectively. Undo history is 50 states deep.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now that you're adept at inserting, deleting, saving and loading notes, we're going to talk about commands for shifting around what's already there.<br/>
					<br/>
					To move a note to a different tick within the phrase, use <b>Shift-Q</b> and <b>Shift-W</b>. To shift all notes in the phrase, use <b>Shift-E</b> and <b>Shift-R</b>. The notes will be moved by a number of spaces equal to the current velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					To shift the active note up or down by a certain number of semitones, use <b>Shift-A</b> and <b>Shift-S</b>. To do this to every note in the phrase, use <b>Shift-D</b> and <b>Shift-F</b>. Again, the notes' pitches are changed based on the velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					To shift the active note's velocity-byte in the same manner, use <b>Shift-Z</b> and <b>Shift-X</b>. For every velocity byte in the phrase, use <b>Shift-C</b> and <b>Shift-V</b>. This also is dictated by the global velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					If you want to automatically add NOTE-OFF commands before each NOTE-ON in the active phrase, hit <b>Shift-Tab-A</b>. Warning: This only works for monophonic phrases.<br/>
					<br/>
					To add NOTE-OFF commands that are spaced apart from their corresponding NOTE-ONs by the Spacing value, use <b>Shift-Tab-S</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					At some point, your keyboard input into PhrasesPd may have stopped working. This, regrettably, is because Puredata and pdlua don't necessarily handle rapid-fire keychords that well. But fear not! Your work is not lost! Hit <b>Space</b> once. This is the keychord panic button, and PhrasesPd ought to start accepting user input again. (To ease your mind: this will never happen with Monome buttons. The underlying structure there is much more reliable.)<br/>
					<br/>
					That is the extent of PhrasesPd's advanced editor commands. In the next installment, we will be talking about ADC Control and Transference.<br/>
