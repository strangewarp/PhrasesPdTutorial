					<b>3. Advanced Commands</b><br/>
					<br/>
					Now, having saved a file, you might be looking at the loadfile box warily, dreading the fact that you would have to type in filenames during a performance. But there is a feature to alleviate this! In the Editor Window, if you look at the rightmost column, you will see a numbered list from 1 to 20. These are the <b>loadfile hotseats</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					You can change your hotseats list by editing the contents of <b>phrases-hotseats.lua</b>. Hit <b>Shift-Number</b> or <b>Shift-Backspace-Number</b> to toggle between loadfile hotseats, and then hit <b>Shift-Tab-Enter</b> to load the corresponding songfile.<br/>
					<i>Note: Loading any songfile will erase any unsaved songdata you might have been editing in the Editor Window.</i><br/>
					<br/>
					In addition to entering MIDI notes with the computer keyboard, PhrasesPd also allows the user to enter MIDI data with an <b>external MIDI device</b>. If you didn't set one previously, go to Puredata's <b>Media</b> menu, select <b>MIDI Settings</b>, and then set the "Input Device" to whatever MIDI device you want to use.<br/>
					<br/>
					Hit <b>Shift-O</b> and <b>Shift-P</b> to select the <b>MIDI-Catch type</b>, which changes PhrasesPd's behavior when it receives notes from the MIDI input device.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now, make sure you are in <b>REC</b> mode, and try entering commands with your MIDI input device. PhrasesPd ought to be catching them now!<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Undo and Redo</b> are <b>Shift-Tab-Z</b> and <b>Shift-Tab-Y</b>, respectively. Undo history is 50 states deep.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now that you're adept at inserting, deleting, saving and loading notes, we're going to talk about commands for shifting around what's already there.<br/>
					<br/>
					There are <b>Cut-Copy-Paste</b> commands, as well, but because the editor is controlled without the mouse, they might be a little different from what you're used to.<br/>
					First, you must set your <b>copy range</b>. Use <b>Shift-Tab-!</b> and <b>Shift-Tab-@</b> to define the top and bottom of the copy range, respectively. (<b>Shift-Tab-#</b> will unset the current copy-range positions.)<br/>
					After defining a range, you may use <b>Shift-Tab-X</b> to <b>Cut</b>, or <b>Shift-Tab-C</b> to <b>Copy</b>. You may then move to any position in any phrase, and use <b>Shift-Tab-V</b> to <b>Paste</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					To <b>move a phrase</b> to an adjacent position on the button grid, switching it with the phrase in said adjacent position, the commands are: <b>Shift-Tab-Up</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Left</b>, <b>Shift-Tab-Right</b>, and <b>Shift-Tab-Down</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					To <b>move a note</b> to a different tick within the phrase, use <b>Shift-Q</b> and <b>Shift-W</b>. To shift all notes in the phrase, use <b>Shift-E</b> and <b>Shift-R</b>. The notes will be moved by a number of spaces equal to the current velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					To <b>change the active note's pitch</b> up or down by a certain number of semitones, use <b>Shift-A</b> and <b>Shift-S</b>. To do this to every note in the phrase, use <b>Shift-D</b> and <b>Shift-F</b>. Again, the notes' pitches are changed based on the velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					To <b>shift the active note's velocity</b> in the same manner, use <b>Shift-Z</b> and <b>Shift-X</b>. For every velocity byte in the phrase, use <b>Shift-C</b> and <b>Shift-V</b>. This also is dictated by the global velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					PhrasesPd can <b>automatically add NOTE-OFF commands</b> to a phrase. It is able to do this in two ways:<br/>
					If you want to add NOTE-OFF commands before each NOTE-ON in the active phrase, hit <b>Shift-Tab-A</b>. <i>Note: This only works correctly for monophonic phrases.</i><br/>
					To add NOTE-OFF commands that are seperated from their corresponding NOTE-ONs by the Spacing value, use <b>Shift-Tab-S</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					At some point, your keyboard input into PhrasesPd <b>may have stopped working</b>. This, regrettably, is because Puredata and pdlua don't necessarily handle rapid-fire keychords that well. But fear not! Your work is not lost! Hit <b>Space</b> once. This is the <b>keychord panic button</b>, and PhrasesPd ought to start accepting user input again. (To ease your mind: this will never happen with Monome buttons. The underlying structure there is much more reliable.)<br/>
					<br/>
					That is the extent of PhrasesPd's advanced editor commands. In the next installment, we will be talking about ADC Control and Transference.<br/>
