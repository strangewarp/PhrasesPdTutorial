					<b>PhrasesPd Tutorial</b><br/>
					<br/>
					<b>2. UI and Basic Commands</b><br/>
					<br/>
					In this section, you will start learning the commands for using PhrasesPd. These are almost entirely keystrokes and keychords. If any of the key combinations strike you as awkward, keep in mind that you can change them by editing <b>phrases-keychord-tables.lua</b>. Stay away from the Ctrl key, though, because that is used for key shortcuts in Puredata itself.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now that you've opened up PhrasesPd, you will see three windows. Those windows are titled:<br/>
					<b>phrasespd.pd</b>: Main Window<br/>
					<b>phrases-grid-gui</b>: Grid Window<br/>
					<b>phrases-editor-gui</b>: Editor Window<br/>
					We will be using all three of these.<br/>
					<br/>
					Focus on the Editor Window; this is where you will be composing your songs. If you have ever used a tracker program, it ought to look relatively familiar. Here are the commands for navigating around a song:<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Up Down</b>: Move the pointer between the notes in a phrase.<br/>
					<b>PageUp PageDown</b>: Page the pointer up and down between the notes in a phrase.<br/>
					<b>Home</b>: Return the pointer to the first note of a phrase.<br/>
					<b>End</b>: Move the pointer to the inverse note from its current location.<br/>
					<b>Left Right</b>: Move to the previous/next phrase.<br/>
					<br/>
					At the top of the second column from the right, you should see a box containing the word "PLAY". Hit your <b>Esc</b> key, and this ought to change to "REC". While in REC mode, you will be able to edit the contents of the song's phrases, and you will be able to tab to any phrase in the editor by pressing your <b>Monome buttons</b> as well.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>zsxdcvgbhnjm,lq2w3er5t6y7ui9o0p</b>: These keys will record notes into a phrase, while in REC mode. On a standard QWERTY keyboard, these keys take the form of a two-tiered piano; if you're on another keyboard layout, you're going to have to change the "kbnames" sub-table within <b>phrases-main-tables.lua</b>.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Backspace</b>: Enter a blank note. Blank notes are important; they mark the end of each tempo tick. If a phrase contains no blank notes, it will fall into an infinite loop, which is really bad! Every MIDI command on the same tick as a blank note will be sent when the phrase reaches that tick.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Delete</b>: Delete a command.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>; '</b>: Change MIDI channel number.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>[ ]</b>: Change octave number.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>- =</b>: Shift velocity value by 1.<br/>
					<b>_ +</b>: Shift velocity value by 10.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>. /</b>: Change MIDI command type.<br/>
					<br/>
					<b>Shift-Up, Shift-Down</b>: Change the spacing value. When a note is entered, a number of blank notes equal to the spacing value will be automatically added thereafter.<br/>
					<br/>
					Once you have entered a few phrases' worth of notes, with the correct MIDI values to activate the MIDI devices in your setup, feel free to hit <b>Esc</b> again to toggle back into PLAY mode. Now you should be able to press those phrases' corresponding Monome keys, and trigger the phrases themselves!<br/>
					<br/>
					If you focus on the Grid Window, you will see that your phrases have come alive!<br/>
					<br/>
					You may notice some lag between when you press your Monome's buttons and when your phrases activate. Don't worry, this isn't a bug - this is PhrasesPd's "gating" feature. In the Editor Window, if you look at the bottommost items in the second column from the right, you will see <b>BPM</b>, <b>TPB</b>, and <b>GATE</b> values. BPM is Beats Per Minute; TPB is Ticks Per Beat; and GATE is the number of ticks that PhrasesPd waits before obeying user commands on the Monome.<br/>
					<br/>
					This is specifically designed so that during their performances, musicians will have some leeway time for triggering phrases, so that superhuman timing is not required. If you are really hardcore, you can set your GATE value to 1; but I advise something in the 10-32 range, depending on the song's tempo and meter, of course. For a song in 4/4 time, a GATE of 16 or 32 is probably best.<br/>
					<br/>
					The song's global BPM, TPB, and GATE can all be changed by using <b>. and /</b>, while in REC mode, to tab through the command-types until you reach GlobalBPM, GlobalTPB, and GlobalGATE. You may then set the value by hitting a note key; the resulting value will be a total of the note's value and the current velocity value.<br/>
					<br/>
					Now, use your Monome to turn off whatever phrases you have playing, but stay in PLAY mode, because you'll be typing things in a moment and you don't want to clog your phrases with unwanted MIDI notes.<br/>
					<br/>
					You will now learn how to save your songfile. Focus on the Main Window, and click on the "Custom Savefile" box. Type in "fancysong.lua", or whatever song name you'd prefer, and then hit Enter, and click on an empty portion of the window to deselect the savefile box. Note: You must always remember to include the ".lua" at the end of your savefile names.<br/>
					<br/>
					We haven't saved your songfile yet, though! You have only entered the savefile name. To save your current songdata to that location, simply hit <b>Shift-?-|</b>. In the Puredata console window, you should see a message along the lines of "Data saved to C:/Users/Christian/My Documents/MUSIC_STAGING/fancysong.lua", which is confirmation that your songdata has been saved to the current active savefile name.<br/>
					<br/>
					Congratulations! You have saved your first song. In the next section, we will take a look at advanced editor commands.<br/>
